# Home-Service-Robot
Final project of the Udacity Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree

This is the final project for the Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree. This culmination uses all the topics covered in the previous
lessons. That includes:
  -Robot Design
  -Gazebo and RVIZ
  -ROS Nodes
  -Localization
  -SLAM
  -Path Planning
I am building a robot that can travel from one position to the next and adjust its path based on the surrounding map changes. Will be 
updating this readme as the project is completed.
